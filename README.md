# KitSelector
PROBLEM: Produce a functioning program for a python class using certain elements: loops, etc.

AKA: Kit selector to ensure appropriate gear in sporty conditions

DESCRIPTION and USE: I've found that my comfort level (am I too hot? Am I too cold?) greatly impacts my enjoyment of an outdoor activity particularly sailing and skiing where your gear is often life support.
My sailing club has a rule that if the combined air and water temperature (F) is less than 120, you must wear a wetsuit or drysuit to participate in frostbiting.  I started with this to help the user select the appropriate gear for the conditions. 

PLANS: I would like to see this refined and scaled up to use crowd-sourcing like for trail rating apps to help more people determine appropriate kit based on other people's preferences and observations if they are not sure.
